ID	Initial Threat	MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s)	Description	Mitigation(s)
TS01	Information disclosure and privacy concerns	T1592 (Gather Victim Network Information); T1040 (Network Sniffing); T1560 (Archive Collected Data)	Attackers can intercept unencrypted NetFlow/IPFIX metadata (not content) to learn topology, hosts, and user activity. Without exporter authentication, an on-path adversary can also impersonate an exporter and inject records.	Use IPFIX/NetFlow over TLS/DTLS with mTLS between exporters and collectors; collectors accept only allow-listed exporter IPs and valid client certs; place collectors in a management network with strict ACLs; consider anonymization/aggregation where required by privacy policy.
TS02	Misconfiguration & lack of access control	T1078 (Valid Accounts); T1562.001 (Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools)	Default credentials, weak auth, or lax collector/exporter access allow unauthorized configuration or data access. Rogue/unauthorized exporters may send flows that the collector accepts as trusted.	Strong auth (unique creds or certs) for exporter/collector management; certificate-based exporter identity; collectors accept data only from known exporter IPs and cert CN/SANs; restrict admin access to mgmt VRF/OOB via SSH/TLS; continuous config compliance to detect disabled export or widened ACLs.
TS03	Denial-of-Service (DoS) & amplification attacks	T1498 (Network DoS); T1498.002 (Indirect Network Flood); T1499 (Endpoint DoS)	Attackers flood collectors with spurious flows or abuse legacy behaviors to amplify traffic. Excess template churn or malformed updates can exhaust parser CPU and queues.	Rate-limit & filter at firewalls; upstream DDoS protection; per-peer connection/session caps and queue back-pressure; template update rate-limits and max template count per exporter; drop unknown/invalid templates; redundant collectors/load balancing and burst sizing.
TS04	Log tampering & defense evasion	T1562 (Impair Defenses); T1564 (Hide Artifacts); T1565.001 (Stored Data Manipulation)	Compromise of exporters/collectors may allow manipulation or deletion of flow records to hide activity or sow confusion. Post-collection files can be edited unless protected.	Centralize flows; store in WORM/append-only with hash-chaining/signatures; strict RBAC & FIM; cross-correlate with other telemetry; maintain accurate time (NTP/NTS) to detect gaps/out-of-order records.
TS05	Data integrity and trust issues	T1565.002 (Transmitted Data Manipulation); T1557 (Adversary-in-the-Middle)	Classic NetFlow lacks per-record integrity. An in-path attacker or spoofed exporter can inject/alter flows in transit to mislead analysts.	Use IPFIX/NetFlow over TLS/DTLS with mTLS; accept only allow-listed exporter IPs & validated client certs; validate Observation Domain IDs; monitor sequence numbers for gaps/rollbacks; validate templates/fields and alert on unexpected changes.
TS06	Vendor-specific & software vulnerabilities	T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application); T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation)	Bugs in exporter firmware/OS or collector software can enable code execution, crashes, or privilege escalation.	Regular patching/updates for exporters & collectors; least-privilege services; hardening baselines; staged/blue-green upgrades; IDS/NDR to detect exploit patterns.
TS07	Unauthorized/rogue exporters injecting fake or misleading flows	T1565.002 (Transmitted Data Manipulation); T1557 (Adversary-in-the-Middle)	A forged or compromised host pretends to be a NetFlow/IPFIX exporter and sends fabricated data, polluting analytics and hiding activity.	Collector allow-list by exporter IP/subnet and client certificate; verify Observation Domain IDs; alert on first-seen exporter; per-source quotas; isolate exporterâ†’collector path in management VRF.
TS08	Template/options abuse to exhaust CPU or evade parsing	T1499.002 (Endpoint DoS: Service Exhaustion Flood); T1562.001 (Disable/Modify Tools)	Malicious exporters can rapidly rotate or corrupt templates/options to consume parser resources or make fields ambiguous.	Template validation/sanity; cap templates per exporter; rate-limit template updates; drop unknown/invalid templates; fail-closed on critical fields.
TS09	Time desynchronization corrupts flow timelines	T1562 (Impair Defenses); T1124 (System Time Discovery)	Skewed clocks on exporters or collectors degrade correlation, detection windows, and forensic integrity.	NTP with NTS where possible; multiple time sources; skew/offset alarms; reject impossible timestamps; record clock state with each batch.
TS10	Sampling/aggregation evasion	T1562 (Impair Defenses)	Adversaries shape traffic to avoid capture under sampled/aggregated flow policies (short-lived or low-rate connections).	Document sampling policy; use unsampled flows at chokepoints/critical segments or increase sampling; complement with packet capture/NDR for high-value assets; surge sampling during incidents.
