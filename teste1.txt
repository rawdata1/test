ID	Initial Threat	MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s)	Description and Mapping	Mitigation(s)
TS01	Eavesdropping / Log Interception	T1040 (Network Sniffing)T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)	Attackers intercept unencrypted Syslog messages in transit to gather sensitive information (e.g. system details, user activities, network configurations). This is often done by sniffing network traffic to capture data ￼. Captured log data can then be exfiltrated over the attacker’s command-and-control channel ￼, exposing vulnerabilities and insights about the target environment.	Encryption: Use TLS (Transport Layer Security) with TCP (per RFC 5425) for log transmission to encrypt messages and prevent eavesdropping. Avoid using plaintext UDP for sensitive logs over untrusted networks. Network Segmentation: Isolate the logging network or VLAN so that log traffic is not accessible to unauthorized users and logging ports are not exposed to the public internet. Secure Channels: For remote log collection, use secure VPN tunnels or IPsec to protect log data in transit, ensuring an encrypted path for sensitive logging information.
TS02	Log Spoofing & Impersonation	T1565.002 (Transmitted Data Manipulation)	Without authentication on Syslog, an attacker can forge log messages to impersonate legitimate devices. By manipulating log data in transit ￼, adversaries can hide malicious activity, trigger false alerts, or create confusion for security administrators. This threat aligns with Transmitted Data Manipulation (altering data en route to hide activity and mislead defenders ￼).	Authenticated Logging: Deploy secure Syslog protocols (e.g. Syslog over TLS with mutual authentication) or message signing to verify the source of log messages and prevent unauthorized sources from injecting logs. Source Restrictions: Implement strict network controls (firewall rules or allowlists) to accept log traffic only from known, trusted IP addresses or host identities, dropping anything spoofed or unexpected. Integrity Monitoring: Use host-based security or configuration monitoring tools to detect unauthorized changes to logging configurations or services (e.g. an attacker adding a rogue log source), and alert on anomalies in log source behavior.
TS03	Log Tampering & Manipulation	T1565.002 (Transmitted Data Manipulation)	Attackers may intercept and modify log messages in transit to remove evidence of their actions or inject false information. This in-transit tampering is an example of Transmitted Data Manipulation, where adversaries alter data en route to its destination to hide their activity ￼. Without integrity checks on logs, such modifications can go undetected, potentially leading responders to draw incorrect conclusions during incident analysis.	Message Integrity: Use secure logging mechanisms or centralized log management that implement integrity checks (e.g. HMAC or digital signatures for each log message) to detect tampering. Enabling Syslog with TLS not only encrypts but also ensures message integrity. Immutable Storage: Configure the log server to write received logs to append-only, tamper-resistant storage (or a write-once medium/remote store) so that once logs arrive, they cannot be altered or deleted. Time Synchronization: Ensure all systems use synchronized timestamps (e.g. via NTP) and include them in logs; this makes out-of-sequence or altered log entries easier to spot and provides a reliable chronological record for investigations.
TS04	Denial-of-Service (DoS) & Flooding	T1498.001 (Direct Network Flood)T1499.002 (Service Exhaustion Flood)	An adversary floods the Syslog service with a high volume of log messages or malformed packets to exhaust system resources (CPU, memory, disk or network bandwidth). This can involve a direct network flood targeting the logging port (Network DoS) and/or overwhelming the log service itself (Service Exhaustion) until it becomes unresponsive ￼. Such a DoS attack disrupts log collection and analysis by making the logging system unavailable or forcing it to drop legitimate log data.	DoS Protection: Use network-based DDoS protection or upstream filtering services to absorb or block excessive traffic before it reaches the Syslog server ￼. Firewalls or IDS/IPS devices should filter known malicious sources and rate-limit traffic to the logging port. Rate Limiting: Configure the Syslog daemon or an intermediary aggregator to limit the rate of incoming messages from any single source IP/device. This helps prevent a single rogue source from overloading the system by dropping or deferring excess messages. Resilient Architecture: Employ a scalable, distributed logging architecture with load balancing and redundant log servers. This ensures that if one node is overwhelmed or fails, logging functionality continues on others. Also consider allocating sufficient buffer/storage for bursts of log data so that brief floods do not immediately incapacitate the service.
TS05	Exploitation of Software Vulnerabilities	T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application)T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation)	Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in the Syslog server software or its underlying OS/libraries (e.g. a buffer overflow in the Syslog daemon or a flaw in glibc). Using an exploit against a listening Syslog service (a network-facing application) can grant initial access or control over the server ￼. Additionally, if the Syslog service is compromised at a lower privilege, attackers might exploit local vulnerabilities to elevate privileges on the system (Privilege Escalation). Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, enabling the adversary to seize or disable the logging server, possibly even turning it into a pivot point within the network.	Secure Patching: Keep the Syslog software and the host OS up to date with the latest security patches. Regularly update or apply hotfixes for any known vulnerabilities (including dependencies and libraries) to close exploits (many attacks abusing public-facing apps rely on unpatched bugs ￼). System Hardening: Apply security best practices to the log server configuration. Disable or remove unnecessary services and binaries on the server to reduce the attack surface, and run the Syslog service with minimal necessary privileges (so that even if compromised, the damage is limited). Enforce the principle of least privilege for any accounts or processes on the logging system. Vulnerability Management: Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests on the logging infrastructure. Identify and remediate weaknesses proactively (for example, known CVEs in the Syslog implementation or OS). Additionally, consider deploying intrusion detection/prevention systems to catch exploitation attempts against the logging server, and restrict access to the Syslog service to only authorized senders to lower exposure.
TS06	Log Poisoning & Information Disclosure	T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application)T1059.004 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell)	An adversary may leverage the logging functionality itself as an attack vector to execute code or leak sensitive information. For example, a format string vulnerability in a Syslog function call can be exploited by sending specially crafted log messages. This attack can cause the Syslog process to expose memory content or even execute arbitrary code (e.g. injecting shell commands). In such cases, the attacker is essentially exploiting the Syslog service (similar to any public-facing app exploit) by feeding it malicious log input ￼. A successful log poisoning attack might allow the adversary to retrieve secret data from the server’s memory via the logs or spawn a shell on the log server (if code execution is achieved). This can lead to serious information disclosure or a complete compromise of the logging system.	Secure Coding Practices: Use safe logging functions and frameworks that treat input as data, not as format strings or commands. Developers should ensure that when calling syslog or similar logging APIs, a format specifier is always used and user-supplied data is properly sanitized (to prevent format string injection ￼). Perform code reviews and utilize static analysis or fuzz testing to catch logging-related vulnerabilities. Input Sanitization: Rigorously validate or sanitize any external data that will be logged. For instance, strip or encode control characters and dangerous sequences in user input before writing to logs to prevent escape sequences or code injection from executing. Limit Sensitive Data in Logs: Configure applications and systems to avoid logging secrets or personal data (passwords, API keys, PII) in the first place. By reducing the sensitive information present in logs, even if an attacker manages to read or poison log files, the impact of disclosure is minimized. Additionally, ensure that logs and log viewing interfaces are not directly exposed to untrusted networks to reduce the risk of log-based exploitation.
