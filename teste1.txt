Absolutely—here’s your TACACS/TACACS+ table rewritten with your exact threat descriptions kept intact, plus the additional gaps I found (new rows at the end) with concrete mitigations you can paste into your doc.

Description	Mitigation(s)
Attackers guess or brute-force weak/default credentials to gain unauthorized access to network devices or the TACACS server itself. Compromised accounts can be used for further attacks.	Strong password policy (length/complexity/uniqueness) and reuse blocking; account lockout/back-off & throttling; per-user admin identities (no shared IDs); enforce access via PAM/bastion with MFA and session recording; disable/rotate all vendor defaults.
The original TACACS protocol transmits passwords in plaintext or with weak encryption, allowing an attacker to intercept them and compromise user accounts through network sniffing.	Upgrade to TACACS+ everywhere; disable legacy TACACS; where supported, wrap TACACS+ with TLS (mTLS) or IPsec between devices and AAA; restrict reachability to TCP/49 from management networks only.
Although TACACS+ encrypts the packet payload, some header information remains in cleartext (e.g., version number, sequence number). An attacker can collect this metadata to plan further attacks or potentially aid in replay attacks.	Management isolation & ACLs (mgmt VRF/OOB, bind to loopback, allow-list TACACS VIPs only); prefer TLS/IPsec wrapping to conceal metadata; block TCP/49 on user/Internet segments; alert on unexpected TCP/49 flows outside mgmt networks.
Attackers with network access can attempt to intercept and modify accounting logs in transit or on a compromised log server to hide their activity and evade detection.	Send accounting to syslog-TLS (6514) on a hardened collector; store in immutable/WORM (object lock) with retention; file-integrity monitoring; strict RBAC (analysts read-only; service accounts write); time sync (NTP/NTS).
Attackers flood TACACS servers with excessive authentication requests to exhaust system resources, leading to service disruption and preventing legitimate users from logging in.	Rate-limit & connection caps on AAA and firewalls; upstream DDoS protection for exposed VIPs; N+1 TACACS+ servers across zones behind a health-checked VIP; devices configured with multiple AAA hosts; alerts on auth-failure spikes/unusual request rates.
In certain scenarios, an attacker can capture and replay a valid TACACS+ authentication or accounting packet to disrupt a session or potentially bypass certain controls. This is particularly relevant if sequence number predictability is a factor or if integrity checks are lacking in a specific implementation.	TLS/IPsec to prevent capture/replay on the wire; enforce short session timeouts, TCP keepalives, and single-connection mode (where supported); drop duplicate/out-of-window sequence numbers; alert on repeated Session-ID/sequence anomalies.
Vulnerabilities in TACACS+ client or server software can allow an attacker to bypass authentication entirely or exploit flaws to gain higher-level administrative privileges on a managed network device.	Regular patching of TACACS+ and OS; run AAA daemons least-privilege (non-root, chroot/containerize); disable unused modules/protocols; continuous vulnerability scanning and config compliance (TACACS+ enabled, per-device secret, ACLs bound, command authorization on, accounting to TLS-syslog, multiple servers present).

Additional gaps (new rows)

Description	Mitigation(s)
Reuse or compromise of shared TACACS+ secrets across many devices increases blast radius if one secret leaks.	Per-device TACACS+ secrets (32+ chars), vaulted and rotated 90–180 days via automation; compliance rule “no global/shared secret”; disable plaintext storage of secrets in configs.
Authorization gaps (flat roles or missing command authorization) allow authenticated admins to run dangerous commands or escalate privileges.	TACACS+ command authorization with default-deny; role-based allow-lists per team/function; log every command (accounting) to SIEM; quarterly review of roles/command sets.
Bypass paths (local accounts or alternate protocols) let operators or attackers sidestep TACACS+ controls.	Disable local admin accounts where possible; if required, break-glass local admin only from OOB with MFA on bastion and post-use review; devices accept SSH only from the bastion; disable legacy/unused AAA methods.
Exposure of TCP/49 beyond management networks enables brute-force, DoS, and recon from untrusted segments.	Place TACACS+ in a management VRF/OOB; device & firewall ACLs permit TCP/49 only to TACACS VIPs; bind TACACS+ to a loopback in the mgmt VRF; never expose to the Internet.
Weak/unencrypted back-end identity store links (e.g., LDAP/AD) can be abused to steal credentials or downgrade auth.	Use LDAPS with mTLS to AD/LDAP; prohibit PAP to backends; least-priv service accounts with rotation; enforce certificate validation and strong cipher suites.
AAA outages or permissive fail-open behavior create security gaps and operational lockouts.	HA architecture: ≥2 TACACS+ servers in separate AZs/VLANs behind a VIP; devices list multiple AAA hosts; fail authorization closed; validated break-glass path (OOB only) with monitoring and ticketed approvals.
Insufficient monitoring misses brute-force, lateral movement, or policy drift.	SIEM/NDR detections: auth-failure spikes, new device IPs contacting AAA, unusual accounting size/rate, sudden role/priv changes; alert on TCP/49 observed outside mgmt networks; periodic control attestation reports.

If you want this delivered as a CSV/Word table, say the word and I’ll generate it.


The AAA ↔ directory link (e.g., TACACS+/RADIUS/PAM to AD/LDAP) uses plaintext or weakly protected LDAP when TLS, signing, or channel binding aren’t enforced, or when STARTTLS can be stripped. An on-path adversary can sniff simple binds, relay NTLM, or downgrade auth to capture credentials and impersonate admins. This enables authorization bypass, privilege escalation, and lateral movement while undermining the integrity of AAA decisions and audit trails.
