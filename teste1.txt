Zero-Trust Principle	Control	Network Construct Layer	Platform Construct Layer	Application Construct Layer	Overall Effectiveness
Authentication and Authorization	Authenticated Logging: Use secure Syslog protocols (such as Syslog over TLS with mutual authentication) or message signing to verify log sources and prevent unauthorized log injection.		✓		Effective
Authentication and Authorization	Source Restrictions: Apply strict network controls (firewalls or allowlists) to only accept log traffic from trusted IPs or hosts, blocking spoofed or unexpected sources.	✓	✓		Effective
Authentication and Authorization	Network Segmentation: Isolate logging networks or VLANs to restrict access, ensuring logging ports are not exposed to unauthorized users or the public internet.	✓			Effective
Encryption	Encryption: Use TLS with TCP (as specified in RFC 5425) to encrypt log transmissions and prevent eavesdropping; avoid sending sensitive logs over plaintext UDP on untrusted networks.		✓		Effective
Encryption	Secure Channels: Protect remote log collection by using secure VPN tunnels or IPsec, ensuring log data travels through encrypted channels.	✓			Effective
Encryption	Message Integrity: Use secure logging systems with integrity checks (like HMAC or digital signatures) to detect log tampering; Syslog with TLS provides both encryption and integrity.		✓		Effective
Least Privilege and Session Management	System Hardening: Configure log server securely by disabling unnecessary services, minimizing privileges for Syslog processes, and enforcing least privilege for all accounts.		✓		Effective
Least Privilege and Session Management	Rate Limiting: Set up the Syslog daemon or aggregator to limit incoming messages per source, preventing overload from rogue devices by dropping or deferring excess logs.		✓		Acceptable
Least Privilege and Session Management	Secure Coding Practices: Use safe logging functions that treat input as data, always use format specifiers, and sanitize user input to prevent format string injection; conduct code reviews and use static analysis or fuzz testing to catch vulnerabilities.			✓	Effective
Least Privilege and Session Management	Input Sanitization: Validate and sanitize all external data before logging, removing or encoding control characters and dangerous sequences to prevent code injection or escape sequence attacks.			✓	Effective
Least Privilege and Session Management	Limit Sensitive Data in Logs: Configure systems to avoid logging secrets or personal data, minimizing the impact if logs are compromised. Ensure logs and log viewing interfaces are not exposed to untrusted networks to reduce exploitation risks.	✓	✓	✓	Effective
Observability/Integration with other security controls	Integrity Monitoring: Employ host-based security or configuration monitoring tools to detect and alert on unauthorized changes to logging setups or abnormal log source behavior.		✓		Acceptable
Observability/Integration with other security controls	Immutable Storage: Store logs on append-only or tamper-resistant media so logs cannot be altered or deleted after arrival.		✓		Effective
Observability/Integration with other security controls	Time Synchronization: Synchronize system clocks (e.g., with NTP) and include timestamps in logs to help identify out-of-sequence or altered entries and maintain reliable records for investigations.		✓		Acceptable
Observability/Integration with other security controls	DoS Protection: Use network-based DDoS defenses and filtering services to block excessive traffic before it reaches the Syslog server; firewalls and IDS/IPS should filter malicious sources and rate-limit logging traffic.	✓			Acceptable
Observability/Integration with other security controls	Resilient Architecture: Build a scalable, distributed logging system with load balancing and redundant servers, ensuring continued operation during failures or overloads, and provide sufficient buffer/storage for log surges.	✓	✓		Acceptable
Observability/Integration with other security controls	Secure Patching: Regularly update Syslog software, host OS, and related dependencies with the latest security patches to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.		✓		Acceptable
Observability/Integration with other security controls	Vulnerability Management: Perform regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests, remediate identified weaknesses, deploy intrusion detection/prevention systems, and restrict Syslog access to authorized senders to reduce exposure.	✓	✓		Acceptable
