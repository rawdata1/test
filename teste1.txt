Got it—here’s the TACACS/TACACS+ Security Capabilities matrix built only from the mitigations in your screenshot, using the exact control text. Checks show where you configure the control. The last column is my overall effectiveness rating for TACACS risk reduction.

Zero-Trust Principle	Control	Network Construct Layer	Platform Construct Layer	Application Construct Layer	Overall Effectiveness
Authentication & Authorization	Strong password policies: Enforce complex, unique passwords for all accounts on the TACACS server and network devices.		✓		Acceptable
Authentication & Authorization	Account lockout policies: Implement policies to temporarily or permanently lock accounts after a specified number of failed login attempts.		✓		Acceptable
Authentication & Authorization	Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Where possible, use MFA on devices and server access to add a second layer of verification.		✓		Effective
Encryption	Upgrade to TACACS+: The most critical mitigation is to upgrade from the outdated TACACS protocol to TACACS+, which encrypts the entire packet payload.		✓		Effective
Encryption	Secure communication channels: If upgrading is not possible, use IPsec or VPNs to create an encrypted tunnel for TACACS traffic.	✓	✓		Effective
Authentication & Authorization	Enforce LDAPS with mTLS to AD/LDAP - Clients configured to RequireTLS, on AD side - LDAP signing = required, LDAP Channel Binding = Required, Simple Bind over port 389 disabled; PAP is not allowed to backends; least-priv service accounts with rotation; enforce certificate validation and strong cipher suites.	✓	✓		Effective
Authentication & Authorization	Minimize network exposure: Isolate TACACS traffic on a separate management network and use firewalls to restrict access to only trusted IPs.	✓	✓		Effective
Encryption	Transport Security Model (TSM): Where supported, use the Transport Security Model as an alternative to the User-based Security Model to enhance security.		✓		Suboptimal*
Observability / Integration	Secure logging: Ensure accounting logs are sent over encrypted channels (e.g., using TLS-encrypted syslog) to a centralized, hardened log server.	✓	✓		Effective
Least Privilege & Session Management	Rate limiting: Implement rate limiting on devices and network access controllers to limit the number of connection attempts from a single source.	✓	✓		Acceptable
Observability / Integration	DDoS protection: Use firewalls to filter malicious traffic before it reaches the TACACS server.	✓			Acceptable
Observability / Integration	Regular patching: Ensure all TACACS+ clients and server software are regularly patched to fix vulnerabilities related to replay attacks.		✓		Acceptable
Encryption	Implement message integrity checks: Where available, enable features that verify message integrity to prevent manipulation or replay of captured packets.		✓		Effective
Least Privilege & Session Management	Use unique session identifiers: Ensure session identifiers are unique and difficult to guess to reduce the risk of successful replay attempts.		✓		Acceptable
Observability / Integration	Regular patching and updates: Keep device firmware and TACACS+ software updated to fix known vulnerabilities, especially those related to authentication bypasses.		✓		Acceptable
Observability / Integration	Host hardening: Apply security hardening best practices to all devices running TACACS clients and servers.		✓		Acceptable

* Note on TSM: Transport Security Model (TSM) / User-based Security Model (USM) are SNMP concepts, not TACACS+. If this line was pulled in by mistake, replace it with “Run TACACS+ over TLS (mTLS) or IPsec between devices and AAA servers,” which would be Effective at the Network + Platform layers.
