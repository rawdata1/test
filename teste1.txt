ID	Initial Threat	MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s)	Description	Mitigation
1001	NTP Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) & Spoofing attacks	T1557 (Adversary-in-the-Middle)	Adversaries can intercept or spoof NTP traffic between clients and servers, causing inaccurate system time. By positioning themselves between devices, attackers may collect or alter time data in transit ￼.	Use NTP authentication (e.g., NTS or symmetric keys) to ensure data integrity ￼; restrict NTP to trusted servers with firewall filtering (M1037) and network segmentation (M1030) ￼.
1002	NTP Amplification & DDoS (e.g., monlist)	T1498.002 (Reflection Amplification)	Attackers abuse NTP’s reflection capability (such as the “monlist” query) to amplify traffic toward victims. NTP has been cited as a prominent vector for reflection/amplification DDoS attacks ￼.	Disable or restrict high-response NTP queries (like monlist) and upgrade to patched NTP versions. Apply rate-limiting and block or filter spoofed traffic at network edges (M1037) ￼.
1003	NTP/NTS Misconfiguration and Implementation flaws	T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application)	Misconfigured or outdated NTP/NTS servers (e.g. using default keys or insecure settings) can be exploited. Attackers target internet-facing services with bugs or misconfigurations ￼, so insecure NTP deployments risk compromise.	Use well-vetted, updated NTP software (e.g. Chrony or NTPsec) and apply NTS correctly (rotate keys, use secure cookies). Disable legacy insecure NTP features. Segment NTP services behind firewalls and restrict access to trusted hosts.
1004	NTP/NTS Denial-of-Service (DoS) & Authentication floods	T1498.001 (Direct Network Flood)	Adversaries may flood NTP servers with high-volume UDP requests or continuous authentication attempts, exhausting resources ￼. Such floods can disrupt time synchronization.	Rate-limit NTP queries and authentication requests at network boundaries. Use upstream DDoS protection and firewall rules to block malicious sources. Monitor for unusual NTP traffic and use redundant time servers to ensure availability (M1037) ￼.
1005	NTP/NTS Log Tampering and Evidence Removal	T1070 (Indicator Removal)	Compromised time servers or clients may have their NTP logs deleted or altered to hide malicious activity. Adversaries often clear or modify logs and artifacts to evade detection ￼.	Centralize and secure NTP logging (e.g. remote syslog or append-only storage). Enable audit trails for NTP configuration changes and use file integrity monitoring to detect log tampering. Restrict log file access to administrators only.
1006	NTP Time Manipulation for Defense Evasion or Privilege Escalation	T1562 (Impair Defenses)	Altering system time via NTP can disrupt defenses and operations: it may invalidate log timelines, disable scheduled tasks, or cause certificate failures. Such tampering impairs the victim’s security mechanisms ￼.	Implement authenticated time protocols (NTS) and restrict time sources to internal, trusted servers. Alert on abnormal clock changes and maintain multiple independent time sources. Audit system clocks regularly and lock down time configuration settings.
1007	NTP as Alternate Channel (Covert C2/Exfiltration)	T1048 (Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol)	Adversaries may encode data in NTP traffic or use NTP queries for command-and-control, effectively hiding malicious traffic in normal time-sync packets ￼.	Restrict outbound NTP to approved servers (filter on UDP 123) and use network segmentation (M1037, M1022) ￼. Monitor for anomalous NTP activity (e.g. frequent queries or unusual payloads) and deploy intrusion detection to flag unexpected NTP usage.
1008	Network Service Discovery via NTP	T1046 (Network Service Discovery)	Attackers may use NTP queries (including legacy features) to enumerate hosts or services on the network. Scanning for NTP services is a recognized discovery technique ￼.	Disable insecure NTP features (monlist) and limit NTP responses to trusted networks. Use firewall rules to block NTP on untrusted interfaces and segment networks so that internal NTP servers do not respond to external scans.
