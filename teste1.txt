A STRIDE-Based Threat Model for SIP and RTP Security in SBC-Protected Networks
Executive Summary
The transition to Voice over IP (VoIP) and Unified Communications (UC) has revolutionized enterprise communication, but it has also introduced a complex and often underestimated threat landscape. The foundational protocols that enable these services, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for signaling and the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for media, were not designed with security as a primary consideration. Consequently, they possess inherent vulnerabilities that expose organizations to significant risks, including service disruption, financial fraud, data breaches, and loss of privacy.
This report provides a comprehensive threat model of the SIP and RTP protocols, structured using the STRIDE framework—a systematic methodology for identifying and categorizing security threats. STRIDE, an acronym for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege, allows for a holistic analysis of the attack surface. Each identified threat is detailed through practical attack scenarios and mapped to the globally recognized MITRE ATT&CK® framework to align the analysis with real-world adversary tactics and techniques.
A central thesis of this report is that a properly deployed and configured Session Border Controller (SBC) is the cornerstone of a robust VoIP security architecture. An SBC is not merely an optional network component but an essential, purpose-built security control that serves as a unified platform for mitigating threats across all STRIDE categories. Its unique position at the network edge and its architecture as a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA) grant it unparalleled visibility and control over both signaling and media traffic, capabilities that traditional firewalls lack.
The analysis herein demonstrates how specific SBC functionalities—such as deep packet inspection, topology hiding, encryption demarcation, dynamic firewalling for media, and sophisticated denial-of-service mitigation—directly counter the threats identified. The following table provides a high-level overview of the threats analyzed in this report and the primary SBC-based mitigations that address them.
| STRIDE Threat | Affected Protocol(s) | Threat Description & Example Scenario | Example MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s) | Primary SBC Mitigation Functions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spoofing | SIP, RTP | Impersonating a trusted entity. Ex: Spoofing a bank's caller ID for a vishing attack. | T1566.004 (Phishing: Voice), T1036 (Masquerading) | STIR/SHAKEN Verification, Mutual TLS (mTLS) Authentication, Dynamic Media Pinholing |
| Tampering | SIP, RTP | Unauthorized modification of data in transit. Ex: A MitM attacker altering the destination number in a SIP INVITE. | T1557 (Adversary-in-the-Middle) | TLS for Signaling Integrity, SRTP with Message Authentication, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) |
| Repudiation | SIP | Inability to prove an action occurred. Ex: An insider making fraudulent calls and logs being insufficient for proof. | T1562 (Impair Defenses) | Comprehensive Call Detail Record (CDR) Generation, Secure Logging (Syslog over TLS) |
| Information Disclosure | SIP, RTP | Unauthorized exposure of sensitive data. Ex: Eavesdropping on an unencrypted call to steal confidential information. | T1040 (Network Sniffing), T1429 (Audio Capture) | Topology Hiding (B2BUA), TLS & SRTP Encryption Enforcement |
| Denial of Service | SIP, RTP | Making a service unavailable to legitimate users. Ex: Flooding a SIP server with INVITE requests. | T1498 (Network DoS), T1499 (Endpoint DoS) | Rate Limiting & Traffic Policing, Dynamic Blacklisting, Call Admission Control (CAC) |
| Elevation of Privilege | SIP | Gaining unauthorized higher-level permissions. Ex: Exploiting a PBX vulnerability that is exposed to the internet. | T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) | Network Demarcation (DMZ Placement), Protocol Normalization, Least Privilege Access Control |
This report serves as a technical guide for network security engineers, system architects, and IT professionals tasked with securing modern communications infrastructure. By understanding the specific threats inherent in SIP and RTP and the comprehensive mitigation capabilities of an SBC, organizations can build a resilient, secure, and reliable communications environment.
Section 1: Introduction to the VoIP Threat Landscape
The protocols that underpin Voice over IP (VoIP) and Unified Communications (UC) are a testament to the flexibility of IP networking. However, this flexibility comes at a cost. The protocols were designed in an era when the internet was a more trusted environment, and as such, security was often an afterthought. To build a robust defense, it is essential to first understand the foundational protocols, the frameworks used to analyze threats, and the primary security control designed to protect this ecosystem.
The Foundational Protocols: SIP and RTP
Modern real-time communications rely on a symbiotic relationship between two core protocols: one for signaling and one for media.
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), defined in IETF RFC 3261, is the de facto standard for signaling in the world of IP-based communications.[1] It is an application-layer protocol responsible for creating, modifying, and terminating real-time sessions, which can include voice calls, video conferences, and instant messaging. SIP's design is intentionally lightweight and flexible, drawing heavily from the request-response model of HTTP. This text-based nature makes it relatively easy to implement and debug, but it also creates a broad attack surface. Because SIP messages are human-readable text, they are susceptible to parsing exploits, header manipulation, and injection attacks if not properly validated. SIP itself does not transport the actual media; its job is to negotiate the parameters of the session and manage its lifecycle.
Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
Once a session has been established by SIP, the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), defined in RFC 3550, takes over as the workhorse for media transport. RTP is designed to carry real-time data, such as digitized audio and video, typically over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to minimize latency. The base RTP protocol specification provides mechanisms for payload-type identification, sequence numbering, and timestamping, which are crucial for reordering packets that arrive out of order and for synchronizing media playback. However, a critical security consideration is that the original RTP standard provides no inherent encryption, authentication, or integrity protection. Unsecured RTP streams are transmitted in the clear, making them completely vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering by any attacker with access to the network path.[2, 3]
The Analytical Framework: STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK
To systematically analyze the threats to SIP and RTP, this report employs two complementary industry-standard frameworks.
 * STRIDE: Developed by Microsoft, STRIDE is a threat modeling methodology that provides a mnemonic for six categories of security threats: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. By examining a system through each of these lenses, security professionals can systematically identify vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked.
 * MITRE ATT&CK®: This is a globally accessible, curated knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. While STRIDE helps categorize what can go wrong, ATT&CK helps map these threats to how adversaries actually operate. By linking threat scenarios to specific ATT&CK techniques, this report grounds the analysis in observed adversary behavior, making the threats more tangible and the mitigations more relevant.[4]
The Central Defense: The Session Border Controller (SBC)
While traditional security devices like firewalls are essential for general network security, they are often ill-equipped to handle the complexities of real-time communication protocols. A Session Border Controller (SBC) is a purpose-built device or software application designed to sit at the edge, or "border," of a network to control and secure real-time communication "sessions".[5, 6, 7]
The most critical architectural aspect of an SBC is its function as a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA). Unlike a proxy that simply forwards messages, a B2BUA terminates a session from one side (e.g., the public internet) and independently re-originates a new session toward the other side (e.g., the internal corporate network). This architecture places the SBC in complete control of both the signaling (SIP) and media (RTP) paths for every call that traverses it.[5, 7] This fundamental design choice is the source of the SBC's most powerful security capabilities, allowing it to inspect, manipulate, and secure traffic in ways that application-agnostic devices cannot. Throughout this report, the SBC's role as a B2BUA will be shown to be the foundational element for mitigating threats across every STRIDE category.
Section 2: Spoofing Threats: Illegitimate Impersonation
Spoofing attacks are designed to violate the security property of Authentication. In the context of VoIP, this involves an adversary illegitimately assuming the identity of a trusted user, device, or network component to deceive a system or a human recipient. These attacks are particularly insidious as they often serve as the first step in more complex fraud or social engineering schemes.
Scenario 2.1: Caller ID Spoofing
Description
Caller ID spoofing is one of the most prevalent and damaging attacks against VoIP systems. An attacker crafts a SIP INVITE message and modifies the signaling headers that control the displayed caller identity, such as the From, P-Asserted-Identity, or Remote-Party-ID headers. The goal is to make the call appear to originate from a trusted or authoritative source, such as a bank's customer service line, an internal IT helpdesk, or even a law enforcement agency. This technique is the primary enabler for Voice Phishing (Vishing) attacks, where the false sense of trust is exploited to trick victims into divulging sensitive information, authorizing fraudulent transactions, or installing malware.
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
This scenario directly maps to T1566.004 (Phishing: Voice), as the spoofed caller ID is the lure used to initiate the social engineering attack.[8] The act of falsifying the identity itself can also be categorized under the broader technique of T1036 (Masquerading).
SBC Mitigation Strategies
A Session Border Controller provides a multi-layered defense against caller ID spoofing, moving beyond simple IP-based blocking to cryptographic identity verification.
 * STIR/SHAKEN Verification: The STIR/SHAKEN framework is the industry's definitive response to illegal caller ID spoofing. An SBC plays a critical role as a Verification Service (VS) at the network edge. When an incoming call arrives from the public network, the SBC inspects the SIP Identity header, which contains a cryptographically signed token. The SBC validates this signature against the public certificate of the originating service provider. Based on the validation result, the SBC determines the call's attestation level: 'A' (Full Attestation - provider knows the customer and their right to use the number), 'B' (Partial Attestation - provider knows the customer but not their right to use the number), or 'C' (Gateway Attestation - provider has no relationship to the call's origin). The SBC's policy engine can then be configured to take specific actions, such as blocking calls with failed validation, flagging calls with 'C' attestation as "Spam Risk," or passing the attestation level to the endpoint for display to the user. This effectively neutralizes spoofing from networks that have implemented STIR/SHAKEN.[9, 10, 11]
 * Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Reputation Services: For traffic from non-STIR/SHAKEN sources, the SBC can leverage traditional access controls. It can maintain static and dynamic ACLs to block traffic from known malicious IP addresses or entire network ranges. Furthermore, modern SBCs can integrate with third-party reputation services via APIs. These services maintain vast databases of phone numbers associated with robocalling, vishing campaigns, and other fraudulent activities. The SBC can query this service in real-time for each incoming call and block or flag numbers with a poor reputation.[12, 13]
 * Ingress Policy Enforcement: The SBC can be configured with powerful, context-aware routing and security policies. A common and highly effective rule is to block any call originating from the untrusted public internet that claims to be from an internal, private number range. Such a call is almost certainly a spoofing attempt and can be dropped immediately at the border, preventing it from ever reaching an internal user.
Scenario 2.2: SIP Proxy and Registrar Impersonation
Description
In this scenario, an attacker aims to insert themselves into the signaling path to intercept or manipulate calls. An attacker on the local network can use techniques like ARP poisoning to trick a SIP endpoint into believing the attacker's machine is the legitimate SIP proxy or registrar server. A remote attacker could achieve a similar result through DNS cache poisoning. Once successful, the endpoint sends its critical SIP messages, such as REGISTER requests containing authentication credentials or INVITE requests for call setup, to the attacker's machine. This establishes a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) position, allowing the attacker to steal credentials, hijack calls, or eavesdrop on signaling.[14, 15, 16]
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
This is a classic example of T1557 (Adversary-in-the-Middle), where the attacker positions themselves between two communicating parties to intercept and control the flow of information.[17]
SBC Mitigation Strategies
The SBC acts as a hardened and trusted rendezvous point, using cryptographic methods to prevent impersonation.
 * Mutual TLS (mTLS) Enforcement: The most robust defense against proxy impersonation is the enforcement of Transport Layer Security (TLS). The SBC is configured to only accept SIP signaling over a TLS-encrypted connection (typically on port 5061). When an endpoint attempts to connect, it is forced to validate the SBC's server certificate, which proves the SBC's identity and prevents the endpoint from connecting to an imposter. For even greater security, Mutual TLS (mTLS) can be deployed. In an mTLS handshake, the SBC also requires the endpoint to present a valid client certificate. This ensures that the SBC only accepts connections from known, trusted, and provisioned devices, effectively locking out any unauthorized machine attempting to communicate with it.
 * SIP Digest Authentication: Even without TLS, the SBC must enforce strong authentication for sensitive requests like REGISTER. SIP Digest Authentication is a challenge-response mechanism where the SBC challenges the endpoint to prove it knows the user's password without the password ever being transmitted in cleartext. This prevents simple credential harvesting by a passive listener and forces an impersonating proxy to attempt to crack the hashed credentials offline, a much more difficult task.[18]
Scenario 2.3: RTP Stream Injection (RTP Spoofing)
Description
This attack targets the media stream itself. If the initial SIP signaling is not encrypted, an attacker can perform network sniffing to read the Session Description Protocol (SDP) body within the SIP messages. The SDP explicitly contains the IP addresses and UDP ports that the legitimate endpoints will use for their RTP media stream. Armed with this information, the attacker can craft their own RTP packets, spoof the source IP address of one of the legitimate parties, and send these packets to the other party's media port. This allows the attacker to inject arbitrary audio (such as noise, advertisements, or misleading instructions) or video into an active call, disrupting the conversation and potentially tricking a user into taking a harmful action.[19, 20]
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
This attack is typically a follow-on action enabled by T1040 (Network Sniffing) of the SIP signaling.[21] The injection itself is executed as part of a T1557 (Adversary-in-the-Middle) attack, where the attacker is positioned to intercept or inject traffic into the communication path.[17]
SBC Mitigation Strategies
The SBC's stateful control over both signaling and media is the key to defeating this attack.
 * Stateful RTP/Media Firewalling (Dynamic Pinholing): This is a cornerstone security function of an SBC that a traditional firewall cannot replicate. Because the SBC is a stateful B2BUA, it actively parses the SDP of a successfully authenticated and authorized SIP session. It knows the exact source IP address and port from which it should expect RTP traffic for a given call. Based on this, it dynamically opens a temporary, specific "pinhole" in its media firewall for that flow and that flow only. Any RTP packet that arrives at the SBC's media interface from an unauthorized source IP address or port—such as from an attacker's machine—does not match an active, authorized session and is immediately dropped at the network edge. This prevents the spoofed media from ever reaching the legitimate endpoint.
 * SRTP Enforcement: As a secondary layer of defense, the SBC should be configured to enforce Secure RTP (SRTP). SRTP not only encrypts the media payload but also provides cryptographic message authentication. Even if an attacker could somehow bypass the dynamic pinhole, a spoofed RTP packet would lack the correct cryptographic authentication tag. The receiving endpoint (or the SBC itself) would recognize the tag is invalid and discard the packet, ensuring the integrity of the media stream.[22]
The security of the RTP media stream is directly and inexorably linked to the security of the preceding SIP signaling. An attacker's ability to successfully execute RTP spoofing is almost always predicated on their ability to first perform information disclosure on unencrypted SIP signaling to learn the session parameters (IP addresses and ports). This underscores a critical principle: securing SIP with TLS is the first and most vital step in protecting the associated media stream.
Furthermore, the emergence of technologies like STIR/SHAKEN elevates the role of the SBC from a simple enterprise security device to a critical node in a global trust framework for telecommunications. The SBC's ability to interpret, validate, and act upon these cryptographic identities is becoming a primary defense against a multi-billion dollar industry of fraud and illegal robocalling, highlighting its strategic importance far beyond basic network protection.
Section 3: Tampering Threats: Unauthorized Modification of Data
Tampering attacks are a direct assault on the security property of Integrity. They involve the unauthorized modification of data in transit, whether it be signaling messages that control a session or the media streams that constitute the conversation itself. A successful tampering attack can lead to call hijacking, fraud, and the injection of malicious content.
Scenario 3.1: SIP Header and SDP Body Manipulation
Description
An attacker who has established a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) position can intercept and modify SIP messages in transit. For example, they could alter the Via or Record-Route headers to ensure they remain in the signaling path for the duration of the call, allowing them to maintain control. They could change the Request-URI in an INVITE message to redirect a call to a fraudulent destination, such as a premium-rate number, resulting in toll fraud. A particularly dangerous form of tampering involves modifying the Session Description Protocol (SDP) body of a SIP message. An attacker could change the media IP addresses (c= line) and ports (m= line) to their own machine, effectively hijacking the media stream. They could also perform a downgrade attack by removing references to secure codecs or SRTP from the SDP, forcing the endpoints to negotiate an unencrypted session that the attacker can then easily eavesdrop on.
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
This is a core activity within the T1557 (Adversary-in-the-Middle) tactic.[17] The MITRE ATT&CK for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) framework also provides a relevant technique, T0830 (Adversary-in-the-Middle), which explicitly includes the modification of network traffic as a key behavior.
SBC Mitigation Strategies
The SBC's ability to terminate and re-originate secure connections is the primary defense against tampering.
 * TLS for Signaling Integrity: The definitive countermeasure to SIP message tampering is the enforcement of Transport Layer Security (TLS). By requiring all SIP signaling to occur within a TLS-encrypted tunnel, the SBC ensures message integrity. TLS includes built-in mechanisms that detect any modification to the data in transit. If an attacker intercepts and alters a TLS-protected SIP message, the integrity check at the receiving end (the SBC or the endpoint) will fail, and the TLS session will be immediately terminated, preventing the tampered message from being processed.[18, 23, 24]
 * Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and Protocol Validation: The SBC performs deep packet inspection on all SIP traffic it processes. Its mature and robust SIP stack parses every header and parameter, validating them against the strict definitions in the relevant RFCs. This process, often called SIP normalization, allows the SBC to detect and drop messages with malformed syntax, invalid structures, or protocol anomalies that might be used to exploit vulnerabilities in less robust downstream systems like an IP-PBX or an IP phone. The SBC can be configured to correct minor non-compliance issues or to reject non-compliant messages outright.[25, 26, 27]
Scenario 3.2: Real-time Media Manipulation (RTP Tampering)
Description
This is a more sophisticated attack where a MitM adversary intercepts an unencrypted RTP media stream and modifies the payload in real-time before forwarding it to the intended recipient. While computationally intensive, this could be used to alter spoken words in a financial transaction authorization, inject false commands into a conversation with a voice-controlled system, or manipulate key frames in a video stream to present misleading information.
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
This is another manifestation of T1557 (Adversary-in-the-Middle), focusing on the manipulation of the media payload rather than the signaling.[17]
SBC Mitigation Strategies
The security of the media stream is ensured through cryptographic means, enforced by the SBC.
 * SRTP Enforcement with Message Authentication: The definitive control against RTP tampering is the use of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). A critical component of SRTP, as defined in RFC 3711, is the inclusion of a message authentication code (MAC), typically a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC-SHA1). This MAC is a cryptographic signature calculated over the RTP header and the encrypted payload. When a packet is received, the recipient recalculates the MAC and compares it to the one in the packet. If they do not match, it is irrefutable proof that the packet was altered in transit, and the packet is discarded. An SBC must be configured to enforce SRTP for all media sessions, ensuring that every packet is cryptographically protected against tampering.[28, 22]
The SBC's role as a B2BUA is what makes it an effective "TLS/SRTP demarcation point." It can terminate a fully encrypted session from an untrusted network, such as the public internet, decrypt the traffic for inspection and policy enforcement, and then re-originate a new, separate encrypted session into the trusted internal network. This allows it to apply security policies without compromising the end-to-end security posture, a function a standard firewall cannot perform without either breaking the encryption or being given access to private keys, which is a security risk in itself.
Furthermore, the threat of downgrade attacks, where an attacker manipulates the SDP to force endpoints to negotiate less secure codecs or to forgo encryption entirely, highlights the critical importance of centralized policy enforcement at the SBC. The security of the communication session cannot be left solely to the negotiation between endpoints, which can be manipulated. The SBC must be configured with a strict security profile that mandates the use of strong encryption (TLS and SRTP) and disallows insecure options. In this role, the SBC acts as a policy enforcement point, overriding any manipulated offers from an attacker and ensuring that all communications adhere to the organization's security standards.
Section 4: Repudiation Threats: Concealing Malicious Actions
Repudiation threats are aimed at undermining the security property of Non-repudiation. This property provides proof of the origin and integrity of data, thereby making it impossible for an individual or entity to deny having performed an action. An attacker seeks to execute a malicious act and then plausibly deny their involvement, often by manipulating or erasing logs.
Scenario 4.1: Denying Call Participation or Actions
Description
An attacker, or a malicious insider, uses the VoIP system to perform a harmful action and subsequently denies responsibility. Examples include making harassing or threatening calls, verbally authorizing a fraudulent financial transaction, or using a phone call to exfiltrate sensitive company data. Without an authoritative, tamper-proof, and detailed record of the session, proving the user's involvement becomes a matter of "he said, she said," which is insufficient for legal or disciplinary action.
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
Repudiation is not a direct tactic within the ATT&CK framework but rather a goal that enables other malicious activities to go unpunished. The act of attacking or erasing logs to prevent attribution aligns with the goal of T1562 (Impair Defenses), specifically sub-techniques like T1562.011 (Spoof Security Alerting) or T1070 (Indicator Removal).
SBC Mitigation Strategies
The SBC, as the central controller for all sessions traversing the network border, is the ideal point to generate high-integrity evidence that counters repudiation threats.
 * Authoritative Call Detail Records (CDRs): The SBC is the most authoritative source for generating Call Detail Records for all external communications. Unlike logs from an endpoint, which can be tampered with if the device is compromised, the SBC's records are generated from a hardened network appliance. A properly configured SBC should generate detailed CDRs for every session, capturing critical forensic data including: source and destination IP addresses and ports, authenticated user identities (SIP URI), call start and end timestamps, call duration, and detailed disconnect cause codes. This data provides a comprehensive and trustworthy forensic trail of every session that crosses the network boundary.[29, 30]
 * Secure and Centralized Logging: To prevent an attacker from covering their tracks, it is imperative that logs are not stored solely on the SBC itself. If an attacker were to compromise the SBC, they could potentially modify or delete local log files. Therefore, the SBC must be configured to stream all of its logs—including CDRs, security alerts, administrative access logs, and configuration change logs—to a remote, centralized, and secure logging platform such as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. This transmission should occur over an encrypted channel, such as Syslog over TLS, to prevent log tampering in transit. Ideally, the SIEM should have write-once or append-only storage characteristics, making it computationally infeasible for an attacker to alter the logs after they have been recorded.
 * Cryptographic Non-Repudiation (Advanced): For environments requiring the highest level of non-repudiation, SIP provides mechanisms for digital signatures. Using Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), a SIP message can be digitally signed with the sender's private key, providing cryptographic proof of origin.[31] More commonly today, the Identity header used in the STIR/SHAKEN framework provides a similar cryptographic signature.[32, 33] An SBC can be configured to log this entire signed header, which serves as irrefutable evidence linking a specific call to a specific originating provider and, by extension, the user they authenticated.[34, 32]
Effective non-repudiation controls, such as secure, centralized logging, act as a powerful deterrent. When potential attackers, particularly insiders, are aware that every communication session traversing the network edge is being immutably logged by a device like an SBC, they are significantly less likely to attempt attacks that rely on plausible deniability, such as toll fraud or harassment.
Moreover, the increasing stringency of the legal and compliance landscape, driven by regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), demands auditable proof of communications and data handling. In this context, SBC-generated CDRs and security logs are no longer just operational tools for billing and troubleshooting; they have become critical pieces of evidence for demonstrating legal accountability, resolving disputes, and proving regulatory compliance.[35, 36, 37] This elevates the SBC to a key component of an organization's broader Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) strategy.
Section 5: Information Disclosure Threats: Exposure of Sensitive Data
Information disclosure threats are a direct violation of the security property of Confidentiality. They result in the unauthorized exposure of sensitive information, which can range from the content of conversations to network topology details and user credentials.
Scenario 5.1: Eavesdropping on SIP Signaling
Description
In this common scenario, an attacker positions themselves on the same network path as the VoIP traffic. This could be achieved by compromising a network router, or more simply, by being on the same unsecured public Wi-Fi network as a user. Using a readily available packet sniffing tool like Wireshark, the attacker can capture all plaintext SIP traffic. Because unencrypted SIP is human-readable, this capture immediately reveals a wealth of sensitive information:
 * Call Metadata: Who is calling whom, the phone numbers or SIP URIs of both parties, the time and duration of calls.
 * User Credentials: If Digest Authentication is used over an unencrypted channel, the attacker can capture the hash and potentially crack it offline.
 * Network Topology: Critically, SIP headers like Via, Contact, and the c= line in the SDP body often contain the private, internal IP addresses of the user agents and servers. This information is invaluable for an attacker looking to map the internal network for further attacks.
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
This is a direct application of T1040 (Network Sniffing).[21] The information gathered from the sniffed packets directly supports subsequent discovery activities, such as T1049 (System Network Connections Discovery) and T1082 (System Information Discovery).
SBC Mitigation Strategies
The SBC acts as both an encryption gateway and an information firewall to prevent this type of disclosure.
 * Signaling Encryption (TLS): The most fundamental defense is to enforce the use of TLS for all SIP signaling that traverses an untrusted network. The SBC should be configured to listen for SIP traffic on the standard TLS port (5061) and to reject any unencrypted connections on the standard UDP/TCP port (5060) from external sources. This creates an encrypted tunnel between the endpoint and the SBC, rendering any sniffed packets unreadable to an eavesdropper.[18, 24]
 * Topology Hiding: This is one of the most vital security functions of an SBC. By acting as a B2BUA, the SBC actively rewrites the SIP headers and SDP bodies of messages as they pass through. It systematically removes any internal, private IP addresses or internal hostnames from headers like Via, Contact, Record-Route, and the SDP c= and o= lines. It replaces these internal identifiers with its own public-facing IP address. To the outside world, it appears as if all communication originates from and terminates at the SBC itself. This completely obscures the internal network topology, preventing attackers from learning the addresses of internal assets like the IP-PBX, media servers, or individual user agents.[5, 38, 39, 40]
Scenario 5.2: Eavesdropping on RTP Media Streams
Description
Similar to the signaling eavesdropping scenario, an attacker with access to the network path captures the RTP packets that carry the actual voice or video data. If the media stream is unencrypted, the attacker can easily reassemble the RTP packets in the correct order using the sequence numbers and play back the entire conversation using standard tools built into applications like Wireshark. This constitutes a severe breach of privacy and confidentiality, exposing sensitive business discussions, financial information, or personal data.
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
This scenario maps to T1040 (Network Sniffing) for the act of capturing the packets and T1429 (Audio Capture) for the subsequent processing and listening of the captured voice stream.[21, 41]
SBC Mitigation Strategies
The SBC's primary role in protecting media is to enforce strong encryption.
 * Media Encryption (SRTP): The definitive mitigation is the use of Secure RTP (SRTP). The SBC must be configured to enforce SRTP for all media streams traversing its interfaces. During the SIP signaling phase, the SBC ensures that the SDP negotiation includes the necessary cryptographic parameters for SRTP. It can manage the key exchange process, whether through SDES (Session Description Protocol Security Descriptions) within the SDP or through a more modern DTLS-SRTP handshake. The SBC can also function as an encryption gateway, for instance, by terminating an SRTP session from a trusted external partner and re-originating a new SRTP session to an internal endpoint. This ensures that the media is encrypted end-to-end, or at a minimum, encrypted over any untrusted network segments.[18, 24, 22, 42]
It is crucial to recognize that topology hiding is not merely security through obscurity; it is a fundamental access control mechanism. By preventing an attacker from ever learning the direct, routable IP addresses of internal systems like the PBX or media servers, the SBC effectively removes the ability for the attacker to launch direct attacks against those potentially more vulnerable systems. The attacker is forced to contend with the hardened, purpose-built interface of the SBC, significantly reducing the overall attack surface of the communications infrastructure.
Furthermore, the impact of information disclosure extends beyond the content of the calls. The metadata leaked from unencrypted SIP signaling—call patterns, timing, participant identities—can be just as valuable to a sophisticated attacker as the call content itself. This metadata can be used to build organizational charts, identify key personnel, understand business operational tempos, and craft highly targeted social engineering attacks. Therefore, encrypting the signaling path with TLS is just as critical as encrypting the media path with SRTP, a holistic security principle that is often overlooked in basic or misconfigured VoIP deployments.
Section 6: Denial of Service (DoS) Threats: Disrupting Availability
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are designed to violate the security property of Availability. The attacker's goal is to render a system or service unusable for legitimate users by overwhelming its resources, such as CPU, memory, or network bandwidth. VoIP and real-time communication systems are particularly susceptible to DoS attacks due to their sensitivity to latency and packet loss. A successful DoS attack can bring a company's entire communication infrastructure to a halt.
Scenario 6.1: SIP Flooding Attacks
Description
This is one of the most common forms of DoS against VoIP systems. An attacker, often using a botnet to create a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, sends a massive volume of SIP messages to a target SIP server or SBC. The most common messages used are INVITE (to initiate calls) or REGISTER (to register endpoints). Each of these messages forces the receiving server to perform stateful processing: parsing the message, performing database lookups, allocating memory for a new session, and generating responses. When flooded with tens of thousands of these requests per second, the server's CPU and memory resources are quickly exhausted, preventing it from processing legitimate call requests. This is a form of Telephony Denial of Service (TDoS) that can effectively shut down an organization's voice services.
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
This attack maps to two primary techniques. If the primary goal is to saturate the network link with a high volume of traffic, it falls under T1498 (Network Denial of Service).[43] If the goal is to exhaust the application-layer resources (CPU/memory) of the SIP server, it is more accurately described as T1499.002 (Endpoint Denial of Service: Service Exhaustion Flood).
SBC Mitigation Strategies
An SBC is specifically designed with hardware and software features to withstand and mitigate these types of attacks at the network edge.
 * Rate Limiting and Traffic Policing: The SBC can apply granular rate limits to incoming SIP messages. These policies can be configured on a per-source-IP, per-destination, or global basis. For example, an SBC can be configured to allow a maximum of 10 new INVITE requests per second from any single IP address. Any requests exceeding this threshold are immediately dropped, preventing a single malicious host from overwhelming the system.[44, 45]
 * Dynamic Blacklisting: Modern SBCs can automatically identify sources of attack traffic. When an IP address consistently violates the configured rate limits, the SBC can dynamically add that IP to a temporary blacklist (or "deny list"). All subsequent traffic from that source is then then dropped at the lowest network layers for a configurable period, consuming minimal SBC resources and effectively neutralizing the attacker.
 * Call Admission Control (CAC): Beyond just rate-limiting individual IPs, the SBC can enforce global policies on the system's capacity. For example, it can be configured to handle a maximum of 50 new call setups per second for the entire system. This ensures that even during a large-scale DDoS attack from thousands of sources, the SBC's resources are not exhausted, and it can continue to process a baseline number of legitimate calls, preserving service availability for some users.[46]
Scenario 6.2: Malformed Packet Attacks
Description
Instead of using high volume, this attack uses precision. An attacker sends a single, deliberately malformed SIP or RTP packet to a target device. This packet is crafted to exploit a specific bug in the target's protocol stack implementation, such as a buffer overflow or an unhandled exception in the parser. A successful attack can cause the target application or the entire device to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
This is a form of T1499 (Endpoint Denial of Service), where the service is disrupted by exploiting a software vulnerability rather than by resource exhaustion.
SBC Mitigation Strategies
The SBC's role as a protocol-aware gateway is key to preventing these attacks.
 * Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and Protocol Normalization: An SBC performs rigorous deep packet inspection on every SIP message that passes through it. Its mature, hardened protocol stack validates each message against the relevant RFC standards. It can identify and drop packets that are malformed, contain illegal characters, have incorrect header lengths, or exhibit other protocol anomalies. This process, often called SIP normalization, effectively "sanitizes" the signaling stream, protecting more vulnerable internal systems like an IP-PBX or individual IP phones, which may have less robust protocol implementations.[47, 25, 26]
Scenario 6.3: RTP Flooding
Description
In this attack, an adversary sends a high volume of UDP packets to the known RTP media ports of a target device. Because RTP typically runs on the connectionless UDP protocol, the target device must process each incoming packet. A high-volume flood can easily saturate the target's network link or overwhelm its CPU as it attempts to process the bogus media stream. For legitimate calls, this results in severe quality degradation (extreme packet loss and jitter) or a complete loss of audio/video.
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
This is a clear example of T1498.001 (Network Denial of Service: Direct Network Flood).[48]
SBC Mitigation Strategies
The SBC's stateful media handling provides a near-perfect defense against this type of attack.
 * Stateful Media Firewalling (Dynamic Pinholing): As described previously, this is the most effective mitigation. The SBC maintains a state for every active, authenticated call. It knows precisely which IP addresses and ports are authorized to exchange media for that session. The SBC's integrated firewall will only allow RTP packets to pass if they exactly match the source IP, source port, destination IP, and destination port of an active media flow. All other unsolicited UDP traffic targeting the media port range is dropped at the network edge. This means an RTP flood from an unknown source will be completely blocked by the SBC and will never reach the internal network or endpoints.
A crucial aspect of DoS mitigation that distinguishes an SBC from a generic firewall is its ability to prioritize traffic. SBCs can be configured to differentiate between trusted and untrusted traffic sources. For instance, SIP traffic from a known, trusted peering partner or a registered internal user can be placed in a high-priority processing queue with generous rate limits. In contrast, an initial REGISTER request from a completely unknown IP address can be placed in a low-priority, heavily rate-limited queue. This intelligent prioritization ensures that even when the system is under a broad-based attack from untrusted sources, it reserves resources to maintain service for legitimate, trusted users.
The threat of Telephony Denial of Service has severe real-world consequences, extending beyond simple business inconvenience. For critical infrastructure like emergency services (E911) and financial contact centers, service availability is paramount. A successful TDoS attack can prevent citizens from reaching emergency responders or prevent customers from reporting financial fraud. In this context, the SBC's role in ensuring availability is not just a technical function but a critical component of business continuity and public safety, making its robust configuration and management a matter of legal and ethical responsibility.
Section 7: Elevation of Privilege Threats: Gaining Unauthorized Access
Elevation of Privilege (EoP) threats are a violation of the security property of Authorization. In these attacks, an adversary exploits a flaw in a system to gain capabilities beyond those they were initially granted. This often involves moving from a low-privilege user account to a high-privilege administrator or root account, which gives the attacker complete control over the system.
Scenario 7.1: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Core Systems
Description
In this scenario, an attacker has already gained an initial foothold on the network, perhaps through a phishing attack or by compromising a less secure device. From this position, they target a vulnerability in a core component of the VoIP infrastructure, such as the IP-PBX or a SIP application server. These systems are often complex and may have vulnerabilities such as unpatched software, default administrative credentials, or command injection flaws in their web management interfaces. Since many of these servers run their services with high privileges (such as 'root' on Linux or 'SYSTEM' on Windows), a successful exploit can grant the attacker complete control over the communications server. From there, they can eavesdrop on all calls, manipulate call routing for toll fraud, or use the compromised server as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.
MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
This is a direct application of the T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) technique, where a software vulnerability is exploited to gain higher-level permissions on a system.[49]
SBC Mitigation Strategies
The SBC's primary role in preventing privilege escalation on downstream systems is to act as a hardened security boundary, preventing attackers from ever reaching the vulnerable services.
 * Network Demarcation and Firewalling: A fundamental principle of secure network design is to place the SBC in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). In this architecture, the SBC is the only component of the VoIP infrastructure that is directly exposed to untrusted networks like the public internet. All other core components, such as the IP-PBX and media servers, reside on a separate, trusted internal network segment. The SBC acts as a strict gatekeeper, filtering all traffic and forwarding only valid, necessary SIP and RTP traffic to the internal systems. This means that an external attacker cannot directly probe or attack other potentially more vulnerable services on the PBX, such as its web administration interface (HTTP/HTTPS), secure shell (SSH), or other management protocols. The attack surface is reduced to only the hardened SIP interface of the SBC.
 * Protocol Normalization as a Virtual Patch: The SBC's deep packet inspection and SIP normalization capabilities can function as a form of "virtual patching." If a known vulnerability in a downstream PBX is triggered by a specific type of malformed or unusual SIP message, the SBC can be configured with a manipulation rule to detect and drop that specific message pattern. This protects the vulnerable internal systems from exploitation, even before an official software patch can be applied by the vendor.
 * Principle of Least Privilege: The SBC enforces the principle of least privilege by its very design. By default, it only allows SIP and RTP traffic to traverse the network border. All other protocols and ports are blocked. This prevents an attacker from using their initial foothold to scan for and exploit vulnerabilities in other services that might be running on the same server as the PBX, such as a web server or database. The SBC ensures that the only communication path available is through the highly controlled and inspected SIP signaling channel.
The most profound function of the SBC in preventing privilege escalation is its role in access prevention. It acts as a choke point, fundamentally preventing the attacker from ever reaching the vulnerable application on the internal network in the first place. This demonstrates the critical value of a layered, defense-in-depth security strategy, where the hardened, purpose-built SBC at the edge protects the softer, more complex, and often more vulnerable application servers in the network core.
This centralized architecture has a significant secondary benefit for security operations. By forcing all external real-time communications to pass through a single point of control, an organization dramatically simplifies its security monitoring and auditing tasks. Instead of trying to monitor every PBX, gateway, and endpoint for signs of an external attack, security teams can focus their efforts on the rich, consolidated logs and alerts generated by the SBC. This makes the SBC not just a policy enforcement point, but also a critical point of visibility and forensic data collection for the entire communications infrastructure.
Section 8: The Session Border Controller as a Unified Mitigation Platform
The preceding analysis, structured by the STRIDE framework, has examined a wide range of threats to the SIP and RTP protocols. A consistent theme throughout this analysis is the central and indispensable role of the Session Border Controller (SBC) in mitigating these threats. The SBC is not merely a collection of disparate security features; it is a unified, purpose-built platform where these features work in concert, leveraging a unique architectural design to provide comprehensive protection for real-time communications.
Synthesis of SBC Security Functions
The effectiveness of an SBC stems directly from its core architecture as a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA). This design allows it to terminate and re-originate every session, giving it complete control over both signaling and media. This fundamental capability enables a suite of powerful, interlocking security functions:
 * Topology Hiding and Information Barrier: By rewriting SIP and SDP headers, the SBC completely obscures the internal network architecture. This prevents attackers from gathering the intelligence needed to launch targeted attacks against internal assets, effectively acting as a primary information disclosure countermeasure.
 * Encryption Demarcation Point: The SBC serves as a trusted boundary where encrypted and unencrypted networks can meet securely. It can terminate TLS and SRTP sessions from the untrusted internet, inspect the traffic for threats, and then re-encrypt it for secure transmission on the internal network. This enforces confidentiality and integrity while still allowing for necessary security inspection.
 * Stateful Protocol Firewall: Through deep packet inspection and protocol normalization, the SBC acts as a highly intelligent, application-aware firewall. It validates all SIP traffic against RFC standards, dropping malformed packets that could be used to exploit vulnerabilities or cause denial of service. Its stateful media firewalling, or "dynamic pinholing," ensures that only RTP traffic belonging to a valid, authenticated session is ever allowed to enter the network.
 * Denial of Service Mitigation Engine: The SBC employs a layered defense against DoS and DDoS attacks. It uses rate limiting, traffic policing, dynamic blacklisting, and call admission control to absorb and deflect floods of malicious traffic, prioritizing legitimate users and ensuring service availability even under attack conditions.
 * Authentication and Authorization Hub: The SBC acts as the primary gatekeeper for the network. It enforces strong authentication using mechanisms like Digest and Mutual TLS. It also serves as the policy enforcement point for STIR/SHAKEN, acting as a verification service to cryptographically validate caller identities and prevent spoofing.
Strategic Recommendations for Deployment and Configuration
To fully leverage the security capabilities of an SBC, organizations must adhere to best practices for its deployment and configuration.
 * Architectural Placement: The SBC should be deployed in a network Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). It must serve as the sole ingress and egress point for all real-time communication traffic between the trusted internal network and any untrusted external networks, including the public internet and connections to service providers. No other path for SIP or RTP traffic should exist.
 * Policy Enforcement: A "deny-by-default" or "zero-trust" security posture should be adopted. The SBC's policies should be configured to explicitly allow only known, legitimate traffic from trusted sources to specific internal destinations. All other traffic should be implicitly denied and dropped.
 * Encryption Mandate: Security should not be optional or negotiable. The SBC must be configured to mandate the use of strong encryption for all sessions traversing untrusted networks. This means requiring TLS for SIP signaling and SRTP for RTP media, and disabling fallback to insecure protocols like unencrypted UDP or TCP.
 * Continuous Monitoring and Auditing: The SBC generates a wealth of valuable security and operational data. It is critical to configure the SBC to stream all of its event logs, security alerts, and Call Detail Records (CDRs) to a centralized SIEM or logging platform in real-time. This provides the security operations team with the visibility needed to detect threats, respond to incidents, and perform forensic analysis.
Conclusion
Securing modern communication systems is not about protecting individual protocols in isolation but about defending the entire real-time communication ecosystem. The Session Initiation Protocol and Real-time Transport Protocol, while foundational, present a significant attack surface that cannot be ignored. This threat model has demonstrated that from spoofing and tampering to denial of service and information disclosure, the vulnerabilities are numerous and the potential impact is severe.
Traditional security tools like firewalls, while necessary, are insufficient on their own as they lack the deep protocol awareness to understand and control the nuances of SIP and RTP. The Session Border Controller stands as the most effective, purpose-built, and comprehensive solution for this challenge. By acting as a B2BUA at the network edge, the SBC transforms the vulnerable perimeter of a VoIP network into a hardened, controlled, and observable security boundary. It is through the strategic deployment and diligent configuration of an SBC that an organization can confidently leverage the power of IP communications while effectively managing its inherent risks.
