Zero-Trust Principle	Control	Network Construct Layer	Platform Construct Layer	Application Construct Layer	Overall Effectiveness
Authentication and Authorization	Use NTP authentication (e.g., NTS or symmetric keys) to ensure data integrity; restrict NTP to trusted servers with firewall filtering and network segmentation.	✓	✓		Effective
Least Privilege and Session Management	Disable or restrict high-response NTP queries (like monlist) and upgrade to patched NTP versions. Apply rate-limiting and block or filter spoofed traffic at network edges.	✓	✓		Effective
Least Privilege and Session Management	Use well-vetted, updated NTP software (e.g. Chrony or NTPsec) and apply NTS correctly (rotate keys, use secure cookies). Disable legacy insecure NTP features. Segment NTP services behind firewalls and restrict access to trusted hosts.	✓	✓		Effective
Observability/Integration with other security controls	Rate-limit NTP queries and authentication requests at network boundaries. Use upstream DDoS protection and firewall rules to block malicious sources. Monitor for unusual NTP traffic and use redundant time servers to ensure availability.	✓	✓		Acceptable
Observability/Integration with other security controls	Centralize and secure NTP logging (e.g. remote syslog or append-only storage). Enable audit trails for NTP configuration changes and use file integrity monitoring to detect log tampering. Restrict log file access to administrators only.		✓		Effective
Authentication and Authorization	Implement authenticated time protocols (NTS) and restrict time sources to internal, trusted servers. Alert on abnormal clock changes and maintain multiple independent time sources. Audit system clocks regularly and lock down time configuration settings.	✓	✓		Effective
Observability/Integration with other security controls	Restrict outbound NTP to approved servers (filter on UDP 123) and use network segmentation. Monitor for anomalous NTP activity (e.g., frequent queries or unusual payloads) and deploy intrusion detection to flag unexpected NTP usage.	✓	✓		Acceptable
Least Privilege and Session Management	Disable insecure NTP features (monlist) and limit NTP responses to trusted networks. Use firewall rules to block NTP on untrusted interfaces and segment networks so that internal NTP servers do not respond to external scans.	✓	✓		Effective
