üö® CRITICAL PRIORITY SECURITY CONTROLS (DEEP DIVE)

1. Authentication & Session Management (Prevent Credential Abuse)

Rationale:
	‚Ä¢	Unauthorized Access Risks: Weak authentication allows attackers to brute-force credentials, session hijack, and exploit authentication bypasses.
	‚Ä¢	OWASP Top 10 Reference: A01:2021 ‚Äì Broken Access Control, A07:2021 ‚Äì Identification and Authentication Failures.
